								<h3>7. Recommendations</h3>
								<p>- Since the Elder (>60yrs) is the customer age group that generated the highest revenue, make sure the product development is user-friendly, e.g Large display and simple user interface.<br/>
                                - Tailor your advertisement to the Elder customers and mention the great feature that can cater for their needs.<br/>
                                - Give incentives to the Returning customers in order to secure their loyalty to the MavTech brand.<br/>
                                - Make sure laptops and smartphones are always in stock, since they are the most sort out products.<br/>
                                - Find out if it is a seasonal influence that causes the high increase in revenue in a specific month, and see if it can be replicated in other months that are performing low in revenue.<br/>
                                - The marketing campaign should be tailored to regions that are performing low in revenue in order to boost sales in all regions.<br/>
                                - Carry out a follow-up on the customers who mentioned the MavTech brand.<br/>
                                - Investigate the unique features of other competitors and see if they can be incorporated into MavTech to prevent your customers from being captivated by your competitors.<br/>
                                - Carry out corrective measures on the neutral and negative sentiment that customers expressed about MavTech.<br/>
                                - In months where we had high engagement comments, carry out an investigation as to the reason. Was it as a result of an issue that was reported? Cross-reference it via the platform in which the comments were communicated.<br/>
                                - Build on the Users who have above-average influencer scores and, with respect to regions, can help build Brand visibility faster, which will be welcomed easily by other potential customers.<br/>
                                - MavTech needs to ensure its product is in good working order before releasing it to the market, as more products are being recalled.<br/>
                                - Also, find out why we have more unfixed products than fixed ones. Does it have anything to do with getting the right spare parts or the lack of technical personnel (Unskilled professional)?<br/>
                                - Although MavTech Brand was mentioned more often, an investigation must be carried out as to the reason we have more Unhappy customers compared to Loyal customers.</p>
