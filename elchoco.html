								<h3>1. Project Title & Company Review</h3>
								<p>El Choco: Unlocking Sales Insights through Data Visualization for European Artisanal Chocolate Brand.<br/>
                                INDUSTRY: Food & Beverage Industry.<br/>
                                El Choco Bite is a prenium artisanal chocolate brand headquatered in Belgium, with operations across several European cities. The company distributes its chocolate bars, bites, and confections through multiple channels: retail outlets, online platforms, and supermarkets.<br/>
                                With an expanding product line and footprint across Europe, they aim to maintain high-quality standards while increasing market share and adapting their product and sales strategy based on regional performance and customer preferences.</p>
								<p>ROLE: Sales Analytics Specialist.</p>
                                <h3>2. Business Problem</h3>
								<p>Despite strong product quality and market presence, El Choco Bite lacks a unified, data-driven view of how its products, salespeople, and delivery strategies are performing across Europe. The leadership team is particularly concerned about underperforming cities, inconsistent delivery statuses, and the need to align pricing, promotion, and product mix with evolving customer behaviour.<br/>
                                They need actionable insights to optimize sales strategy, delivery efficiency, and regional performance.</p>
								<h3>3. Business Objectives</h3>
								<p>- To analyze El Choco Bite's sales performance across various locations, sales channels, and product lines.<br/>
                                - Identifying patterns, inefficiencies, workforce and growth opportunities.<br/>
                                - Produce interactive Tableau dashboards to help business leader make informed decision on product ositioning and channel strategy.</p>
								<h3>4. My Approach</h3>
								<p>- Data loading of MS Excel dataset.<br/>
								- Data preparation<br/>
                                - Business insights.<br/>
                                - Dashboard building.<br/>
                                - Recommendations.</p>
                                <p>TOOL USED: Tableau</p>
								<h3>5. Key Deliverables</h3>
								<p>Delivered a Tableau dashboard to improve data-driven decision-making</p>

								<h3>6. Insights</h3>
								<p>- The Month of January generated the most revenue of €821,710, and the company experienced a downturn in revenue of €539,678 in February, which is the lowest revenue generated throughout the year. The month of June, with €796,260 generated in revenue, is the second-highest revenue after January throughout the year.<br/>
                                - Italy has the highest box shipped, with 33,568 in complete transactions and 706 cancelled; next is Spain with 32,313 boxes completely shipped and 1,133 boxes cancelled. But compared to the difference in the delivery status of the boxes shipped, Switzerland has the lowest: 22,391 complete shipments & 340boxes cancelled. France is the only country with no cancelled transactions, with over 11,403 successfully shipped boxes.<br/>
                                - More customers preferred making transactions via the Website in comparison with going to the Warehouse and making a purchase via their Social Media Handle.<br/>
                                - From the profit target of €100,000 with the quantity sold, Karlen McCaffrey made the highest Profit of €131,994 and sold over 9,658 in Quantity, which is also the highest; followed by Beverie Moffet with €120,956 in Profit and 9,214 in Quantity sold.</p>
								<h3>7. Recommendations</h3>
								<p>- Investigate the cause of the month doing the highest revenue and examine if the reason can be replicated in other months that are doing low in revenue: Could it be as a result of a special discount due to season change (January)?<br/>
                                - The Salesperson should help specify & give more reasons that some transactions were cancelled to improve the experience of each customer during their purchase. This will in turn help improve the revenue of El Choco Bite in respective countries.<br/>
                                - There should be a compensation system (monetary/non-monetary) that rewards Salespeople for doing well in driving more revenue, this is money aside from their salary (Quarterly/Annually).<br/>
                                - Products within the Dark Chocolate, Milk Chocolate & Nut Chocolate should be available since they are in high demand, while the demand level of other products must be examined.<br/>
                                - El Choco Bite should focus on Inorganic products while finding a means to build its customer base for Organic chocolate products.</p>
