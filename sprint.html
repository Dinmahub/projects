                                <h3>2. Business Problem</h3>
								<p>Sprint Legacy Lab. has been experiencing some challenges despite their success:<br/>
                                - High attrition rates have been observed, which could impact productivity and organizational performance.<br/>
                                - Lack of a clear understanding of attrition trends across departments, demographics, and tenure.<br/>
                                - Difficulty in identifying factors influencing recent attrition and low survey scores.<br/>
                                There is a need for better visualization of workforce data to support decision-making.</p>
								<h3>3. Business Objectives</h3>

                                - Analyze workforce demographics by department, gender, age group, and education level to understand patterns.<br/>
                                - Track attrition trends over time and compare survey scores with employee turnover rates.<br/>
                                - Build a comprehensive dashboard to enable HR teams to make data-driven decisions.</p>
								<h3>4. My Approach</h3>

								<h3>6. Insights</h3>
								<p>ATTRITION TREND:<br/>
                                - Employees that have stayed within 2 years in the Organization were the highest number to resign.<br/>
                                - The next higher numbers were those who had spent 7 years in the Organization.<br/>
                                EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE:<br/>
                                - From the Total Attrition (243): Based on gender, the number of females who resigned is 87, and males is 156.<br/>
                                - Based on Age group: The highest attrition was between the 27-35, this might be as a result of a career change.<br/>
                                - The other age group with high attrition number compared to retention is 18-26, which is most likely due to voluntary change of job since employees in this category are still green.<br/> 
                                DEPARTMENT ATTRITION:<br/>
                                - Comparing the Attrition rate of each department, the Sales Dept has the highest of 21%, next is the HR Dept with 19% and lastly the Research & Development Dept with 14%.<br/>
                                - More employees with these job roles: Lab. technician, Sales Executive and Research Scientist resigned from the Organization.<br/>
                                SATISFACTION SURVEY SCORE:<br/>
                                - According to the chart, employees in Lab. technician, Sales Executive and Research Scientist are the ones performing excellently across the survey score rank.</p>
								<h3>7. Recommendations</h3>
								<p>- Let the HR department find out the reason a huge number of employees who have not spent more than 2 years in the organization are resigning. This is to be done so as to see if organization policies can be improved/adjusted to retain rare talent.<br/>
                                - Seeing that large percent of attrition is coming from the job roles of laboratory technician, Sales executive & Research scientist, investigate the root cause. They are the roles filled with diligent employees across the satisfactory survey score.<br/>
                                - Monthly Conference for professional upskill should be carried out for all departments with low performance.</p>
